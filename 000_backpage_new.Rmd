“I learned a lot working through their solutions — it's a great way to broaden and deepen your understanding of R. (I should probably go through it again...)”
- (Greg Wilson | RStudio, PBC)

This book offers solutions to all 284 exercises in Advanced R. It is based on our own efforts to work through Advanced R to learn the R programming language in an efficient and sustainable way. To this end, we have carefully documented the solutions and made them as accessible and clear as possible. All solutions were carefully reviewed by Hadley Wickham.

Working through the exercises and their solutions will give you a deep understanding of a variety of programming challenges, many of which are relevant to everyday work. This will expand your set of tools on a technical and conceptual level. You will be able to transfer many of the specific programming schemes directly; moreover, in many situations far more elegant alternatives will open up to you.

By working through the questions and answers in this book, you'll learn:
  
* When R creates copies, and how it affects memory usage and code performance
* Everything you could ever want to know about functions
* The differences between calling and exiting handlers
* How to employ functional programming to solve modular tasks
* The motivation, mechanics, usage, and limitations of R's highly pragmatic S3 OO system
* The R6 OO system, which is more like OO programming in other languages
* The rules that R uses to parse and evaluate expressions.
* How to use metaprogramming to generate HTML or LaTeX with elegant R code.
* How to identify and resolve performance bottlenecks.

Malte Grosser is a business mathematician from Hamburg, who has been programming in R regularly since the beginning of his career. He is currently finishing his PhD on machine learning for stroke outcome prediction and develops solutions in business as a Data Scientist.

Henning Bumann is a psychologist and statistician who enjoys making sense of data and is motivated to build data-driven solutions that are beautiful and meaningful. He prefers free programming tools to support effective and transparent collaboration. 

Hadley Wickham is the original author of Advanced R, created all the exercises and supported this project by reviewing all the proposed answers.
