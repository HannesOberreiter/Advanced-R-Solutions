“I learned a lot working through their solutions — it's a great way to broaden and deepen your understanding of R. (I should probably go through it again...)”
- (Greg Wilson | RStudio, PBC)

This book offers solutions to all 284 exercises in Advanced R. It is based on our own efforts to work through Advanced R to learn the R programming language in an efficient and sustainable way. To this end, we have carefully documented the solutions and made them as accessible and clear as possible. All solutions were carefully reviewed by Hadley Wickham, the author of Advanced R.

Working through the exercises and their solutions will give you a deep understanding of a variety of programming challenges, many of which are relevant to everyday work. This will expand your set of tools on a technical and conceptual level. You will be able to transfer many of the specific programming schemes directly; moreover, in many situations far more elegant alternatives will open up to you.

From a technical and R-specific perspective, you will learn about:
*	When R creates copies, how this affects memory and performance, and how to address this
*	The characteristics of base R's vector data types and how to choose between their different subsetting options
*	Everything you could ever want to know about functions
*	How to work with and recurse over environments
*	The differences between calling and exiting handlers
*	How to employ functional programming to solve modular tasks
*	The mechanics, usage, and limitations of R's highly pragmatic S3 OO system
*	The R6 OO system, which is more like classical OO programming in other languages
*	R's S4 OO system, which extends S3 with multiple dispatch, multiple inheritance, and much stricter formalities
*	How R parses expressions into elements of abstract syntax trees before it evaluates them
*	How you can modify these elements and their environments within this process
*	How to use this technique to create domain specific languages such as HTML or LaTeX
*	Identifying performance bottlenecks and strategies to resolve them like vectorization or rewriting in C++
