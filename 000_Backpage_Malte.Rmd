> “I learned a lot working through their solutions — it's a great way to broaden and deepen your understanding of R. (I should probably go through it again...)”

This book offers solutions to all 284 exercises in Advanced R. It is based on our own efforts to work through Advanced R to learn the R programming language as efficiently and sustainably as possible and provides a convenient point of reference. To this end, we have carefully documented all our solutions and made them as understandable and clear as possible. All solutions were carefully reviewed by Hadley Wickham, who also helped us when some exercises seemed unsolvable at first.

Working through the exercises and their solutions will give you a deep understanding of a variety of programming problems, many of which you might encounter again in your daily work with R. It will give you a great set of tools to solve some of these problems not only technically but also conceptually. In the process, you will develop a good sense of identifying meaningful measures to compare different approaches. While in some situations you will be able to transfer certain programming schemes directly, in many others far more elegant options might open up to you. As a positive side effect, your fluency in R will notably increase.

From a technical and R-specific perspective, you will learn about

Malte Grosser is a business mathematician from Hamburg, who has been programming in R regularly since the beginning of his career. He is currently finishing his PhD on machine learning for stroke outcome prediction from medical images and develops solutions in business as a Data Scientist. Malte likes to promote and engage in the local R community and is the author of the snakecase package, which converts strings into arbitrary cases.

Henning Bumann is a psychologist and statistician who enjoys making sense of data and is motivated to build data-driven solutions that are beautiful and meaningful. He prefers free programming tools to support effective and transparent collaboration. He is happy to be an active member of the Hamburg R community and considers learning to code one of the most fortunate junctions in his professional life. Away from the computer Henning likes to take it easy and spend time in nature and with family and friends.

Hadley Wickham is the original author of Advanced R and helped us by lightly reviewing the proposed answers.
