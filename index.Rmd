This is the website for **"Advanced R Solutions"** which provides solutions to the exercises from Hadley Wickham's [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/), 2nd edition. A print version of this book will soon be released as part of Chapman & Hall's R Series. Working through the exercises and their solutions will give you a deep understanding of a variety of programming challenges, many of which are relevant to everyday work.

Solutions to the first edition of Advanced R can be found at https://advanced-r-solutions-ed1.netlify.com.
