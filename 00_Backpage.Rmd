## Requirements/ Guidance from C&H
- First one or two paragraphs should present background, aims and scope, and what sets the book apart.
- Third (or second, if only one above) paragraph is actually a bulleted list of the key features (try to be as specific as possible).
- Final paragraph is a summary including audience (although this may feature at the beginning).
- If there is room, you can include a short author bio at the end.

## Maltes Proposal
Do you want to deepen your R-skills and build up knowledge to master the application of R from the bottom up?

Advanced R Solutions gives you a great boost to fully internalise Hadley Wickham's Advanced R and benefit enormously from it in your everyday work.

Advanced R provides programmers from all languages with a comprehensive insight into the world of professional R programming. It shows that, “despite its sometimes frustrating quirks, R is, at its heart, an elegant and beautiful language, well tailored for data science”. It gives you an entry to dive into the material yourself with almost 300(!) exercises, which are provided throughout its chapters.

Advanced R Solutions supports you on this journey with appropriately detailed solutions for each of these exercises. The entire content, including the R-code, has been carefully prepared and revised with the help of Hadley Wickham.

## Hennings Proposal
### Paragraph 1/2
This book provides solutions to the exercises offered in Advanced R (Wickham, 2019) and reflects our effort to understand and learn the content presented in it.

it is written

## Testimonials:
By @gvwilson on Twitter (https://twitter.com/gvwilson/status/1119235643652157440) (I think he’s Greg Wilson; Data Scientist and Professional Educator from RStudio. I would still need to ask for his permission): “I learned a lot working through their solutions — it's a great way to broaden and deepen your understanding of R. (I should probably go through it again…)”

# Author Bios (75-100 words long each)
### Malte Grosser
Malte Grosser is a business mathematician from Hamburg who has been programming regularly in R since the beginning of his career in science and business. After initial benefits in his doctoral thesis at the local university hospital, he often had to develop robust business solutions in R as a consultant. One evening, when there was another bug in a solution for an important project, he thought for a long time about how he could improve his R-skills ... and ended up at “Advanced R”.

### Henning Bumann
As a psychologist and statistician Henning enjoys making sense of data and is motivated to build data-driven solutions that are both beautiful and meaningful. He prefers free programming tools to support effective and transparent collaboration. He is happy to be an active member of the R community and considers learning to code one of the most fortunate junctions in his professional life. Away from the computer Henning likes to take it easy and spend time in nature and with family and friends.

- maybe mention Hamburg
- build and contribute together
- improve his coding habits
- eager to learn new things

### Hadley Wickham (from Adv R)
Hadley Wickham is Chief Scientist at RStudio, an Adjunct Professor at Stanford University and the University of Auckland, and a member of the R Foundation. He is the lead developer of the tidyverse, a collection of R packages, including ggplot2 and dplyr, designed to support data science. He is also the author of R for Data Science (with Garrett Grolemund), R Packages, and ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis.
